# With differences in frequencies of haplotypes in forqs ---> simreads ---> harp

There is a way with forqs, to output what I think is the frequency of the provided
DGRP haplotypes forqs used to start the simulation, at the end of the simulation in 100kb windows.
File will look like...
pos freq1   freq2   freq3....freqn (n being the number of DGRP haplotypes)
--I gave forqs ambiguous haplotypes names, 1 - 106, because the actual DGRP numbers aren't needed
--during the simreads simulations, this is because I'm giving simreads 200 diploid individuals to simulate
--reads from, which are a mosaic of DGRP haplotypes, so DGRP frequency is not provided to simreads, only the
--frequency of those made up individuals, which all have the same frequency because a fly can only be sampled once during
--the collection of flies for DNA pool-seq.  Simreads creates a true.freqs output file, and an actual.freqs output file.
--I believe what that is doing is showing the difference between the starting frequency values I gave, and the
--frequency value within the simulated reads (so I think those files could be used to determine how much noise simreads
--is adding into the read pool.  Going back to forqs, those frequency outputs of DGRP haplotypes at the end of the simulation,
--can be compared to the HARP frequency estimates which are run on the simulated reads.  If the output of harp, always
--aligns with the end of forqs, simreads is pointless.  I believe the order of the DGRP number frequencies in the
--forqs outputs will be the order of the mixed_haplotypes.txt columns (I need to get the header of this file though).  Not sure
--the order of harp frequency outputs, but I have a script that adds the DGRP info to those HARP outputs becuase I made those
--HARP frequency plots
